# Solution for job-interview coding challenge

The challenge is as follows: 

Given

1. a sentence, and
2. a list of words that are allowed in the language of the sentence
3. a MD5-hash

find an anagram of 1. (using the words in 2.) such that the MD5-hash of the anagram matches 3.



## Short description of solution

Out of preference I chose to build this as an Xcode-project, initially targeting an iOS-app.
